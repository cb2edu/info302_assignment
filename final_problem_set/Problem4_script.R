##Test the hypothesis that highly abundant domains will have higher chance of accummulating variations 
##First run problems 1 and 2 scrips and save output in files 
##Use an R script to read the files created in problems 3 and 4. 
##draw a linear regression plot between the abundance in X-axis and number of variations in Y-axis
##should report the correlation between the two

##run problem 1 script

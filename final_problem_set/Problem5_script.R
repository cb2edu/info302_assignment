# Question: How many adults could you fit standing shoulder to shoulder in the state of Texas?
# Starting Point: Texas is 268,597 sq mi

# The average height for women if 5 ft 4 in and 5 ft 9 in for men in the US
# So the average height for any adult in the US is 5 ft 6.5 inches 
# it is suggested that men and women keep their waist circumference no more than half their height 
# 5 ft 6.5 inches is 66.5 inches so suggested average waist circumfrence is 33.25 inches 
# The average waist to shoulder ratio is 1.6
# average shoulder width is 53.2 inches or 4 ft 5 inches 
# Using the shoulder width I would say the average person takes up about 9 square feet 
# Texas is 268,597 sq mi or 7.4880546e+12 sq ft 
# Divide 7.4880546e+12 sq ft by 9 sq ft is 832,000,000,000
# so 832,000,000,000 can fit standing up next to each other in Texas
